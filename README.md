![FLUXION](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=FLUXION+Traffic+Management+System)

## üåü Overview

FLUXION is an advanced AI-powered traffic management system designed to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance road safety. By leveraging computer vision, machine learning, and reinforcement learning technologies, FLUXION dynamically adjusts traffic signals based on real-time traffic conditions.
This system aims to revolutionize traditional fixed-time traffic signal systems with intelligent, adaptive solutions that respond to actual traffic demands.
